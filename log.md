# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Jan Challenge on Code Chef. Practised React.

**Thoughts:** The question was in python and was relatively easy. React is becoming clearer the more I work on it.

### Day 2: January 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a problem on code Chef. Learnt to use React-Router.

**Thoughts:** This question wasn't very challenging either but since it has been a while it took my longer than expected.I'm using it to get back upto speed with python. React router is a very useful a necessary tool to navigate between components.

### Day 4: January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt about the dropdown feature and integrating it with react-router. I made a sidebar to my project and made navigation through it operational.  

**Thoughts:**  It's very easy to integrate react-router with most components in the project. The dropdown component is a lifesaver.
